          I’m a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> who loves turning ideas into

            My journey began in <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong>, where I
            discovered how logic and creativity could blend through{" "}
            <strong>robotics</strong>. That curiosity soon grew into a passion
            for software, especially on <strong>Front-End</strong> — where
            design meets functionality and every detail shapes how people feel
            when using a product.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since then, I’ve built and maintained applications with technologies
            like <code>ReactJS</code>, <code>TypeScript</code>,{" "}
            <code>HTMX</code>, and <code>Go</code>. I worked on internal
            dashboards and backend systems that improved performance, and
            streamlined workflows.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe great engineering is about{" "}
            <strong>clarity, collaboration, and care</strong> — writing code
            that not only works, but communicates intention and creates impact.
